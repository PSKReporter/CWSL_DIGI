This file contains setup instructions for CWSL_DIGI.

Create a folder on the local hard drive for CWSL_DIGI and place all files 
there. The suggested folder is C:\CWSL_DIGI.

Open the file "config.ini" in your favorite text editor. The format should be
self-explanatory. Set the following options:
callsign
gridsquare
Next, enable at least one decoder. See the [decoders] section. It is suggested
to start with one decoder until the program is running and configured properly.

Next, in the [wsjtx] section, change the "binpath" option to the correct
folder, if not already. The folder must contain jt9.exe and wsprd.exe.

Now, start CWSL_DIGI. Spots should begin to appear in the console window.

To enable logging to spotting networks, review the settings in the [reporting]
section of the config file.

Review the file CALIBRATION.txt to calibrate your receiver.
